Finally! My very first CSS Project from The Odin's Fpundations Course. 
At first, I was lost and did not know how to start from a blank html page, 
I did try to finish the mock up within 3 days but I was not satisified with the result. 
First, I did not feel that I am putting the margin and padding properly and if its in the right places, 
I just literally copied how it literally looks without considering if the page will break or not, until I checked the result on a mobile screen. man, it sucked! 
that's when I started researching a little bit more out of the odin's materials and came across this one educator that talks more about mobile first approach, 
I also did the short intro about responsive design by interneting is hard and it really helped.  

I am still not 100% happy about the result of this project and I know that I need to re-do this a couple of more times to make sure all the information sticks in my brain. 
The code is not clean, but I want to save this progress for now. If I have the time, I will get back to it and clean it a bit more.
